The team discussed various factors including user analytics showing 65% mobile usage, the development team's experience with mobile frameworks, and resource constraints. A phased approach was proposed, starting with mobile development followed by desktop optimization. The team also considered adopting a progressive web app approach to serve both platforms efficiently. Security and compliance concerns were raised as important considerations regardless of the chosen platform. The final decision favored a mobile-first strategy with responsive design to accommodate desktop users.",
